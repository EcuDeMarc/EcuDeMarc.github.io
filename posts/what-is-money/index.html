			<h1>What Is Money?</h1>

				<p>What is money?</p>
<p>Is it a medium of exchange?</p>
<p>Is it a convenient tool we all decide to use to carry out transactions?</p>
<p>I would argue it is not a medium of exchange and it is not a convenient tool we use to perform transactions.</p>
<p>Instead, I believe that money is a measurement device of value. In other words, it is a unit of account. Like we use the Fahrenheit scale to measure temperature, we use money to measure value.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need money to carry out transactions. We can use any mean of payment or medium of exchange to perform transactions. For example, we can use gold bars in a transactions. But, we have to have a way of measuring the value of these gold bars in order to settle the transaction. This is when money comes in handy. We would not be able to use gold bars in a transaction without the measuring device of money.</p>
<p>The question then becomes how is the money measuring device defined? Who defines it? How is it possible to enfore the use of this measuring device?</p>
<p>The answer is simple. The device can only be defined and enforced by the Government.</p>
<p>Can it be defined and enforced by an institution other than the Government? I would argue the answer to this question is no.</p>
<p>The reason is that Government is the only sovereign institution in any society. The measuring device of money can be defined and enforced only be sovereign institutions.</p>
<p>Why only sovereigns? The reason is that sovereigns have the right to force citizens to accept payment for services rendered to it and have the ability to force citizens to pay taxes in exchange for services rendered. The crucial bit of information here is that the sovereign is able to <strong>force</strong> citizens into an agreement. This is of paramount importance. Without <strong>force</strong> it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to define money and enforce the use of the measuring device of money.</p>
<p>How does the sovereign define money? The sovereign can simply pay its employees a fixed amount of money for services rendered. This creates a fixed exchange rate between the monetary unit and an amount of services being rendered. What if the same services are renumerated more generously in the private sector? If this happens, the government can simply increase taxes to ensure that private sector net pay is in line with public sector pay.</p>
<p>Thus, the sovereign can use public expenditure and taxes to define the measuring device of money and enforce its appropriate use in wider society.</p>
<h2 id="is-gold-money">Is Gold Money?</h2>
<p>It is widely held that gold is money since we can use it in a transaction as a means of payment and medium of exchange.</p>
<p>I would argue that gold is not money since it is not a measuring device. It is simply a commodity that humans tend to value highly.</p>
<p>Gold in itself is not money since alone it cannot <strong>force</strong> people using it in transactions to exchange it for a fixed amount of services/goods (only sovereigns can do this).</p>
