			<h1>What is the motivation behind the introduction of the Central Bank Digital Currency (&#34;CBDC&#34;)?</h1>

				<p>Many central banks across the world are all pursuing the idea of introducing a retail payment system commonly named Central Bank Digital Currency (&ldquo;CBDC&rdquo;). In reality, this is not a currency but simply an alternative payment system that would sit alongside other existing payment systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central bank managed wholesale payment system (e.g. <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/wires/">Fedwire</a>)</li>
<li>Private payment systems (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Paypal)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear to all that the current payment system landscape is dominated by private actors. You could argue that it is the &ldquo;free market&rdquo; and the preference of customers that determine which payment systems succeed and which do not. On the other hand, central bank managed payment systems currently revolve around serving the needs of businesses and not of the retail client (this has not always been the case since in the past central banks did serve a retail crowd as well as a business clientele).</p>
<p>As a result, one could argue that introducing a retail payment system sponsored and managed by the central bank makes sense since it is an area not covered by the central bank. At the same time, that would entail changing the relationship the central bank currently has with other banks (e.g. commercial banks). Would the introduction of the so called &ldquo;CBDC&rdquo; mean disrupting the intermediation role that commercial banks currently play in today&rsquo;s financial system? I think this is not the case due to three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would disrupt the financial stability of any country. This is anathema to any ruling elite.</li>
<li>Many of the currently proposed &ldquo;CBDC&rdquo; schemes impose restrictions on the amount of money users can move. This would prevent users from moving all of their funds from current commercial bank deposits to this new type of deposit.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1025235/G7_Public_Policy_Principles_for_Retail_CBDC_FINAL.pdf">G7 commitment</a> relating to &ldquo;CBDCs&rdquo; that explicitly states that any &ldquo;CBDC&rdquo; design should not imperil the stability of the country&rsquo;s financial system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the above, it is clear that this new payment system is going to accommodate and not disrupt the current relationship between the central bank and commerical banks.</p>
<p>As a result, one could reasonably assume that, given that the retail crowd is happy with and used to paying for goods and services with user friendly private payment systems such as Visa and Mastercard, the &ldquo;CBDC&rdquo; payment system will not dislodge private payment systems from dominating the retail payment landscape. The reason for this is simple, private actors, such as commerical banks, have decades of experience catering to the needs of the retail crowd. The central bank lacks this experience and proven track record. Thus, it is doubtful a central bank can, all of sudden, succeed in building a retail payment system that is going to beat privately designed ones.</p>
<p>Given all of the above reasoning, if you agree with it, one should then ask what is the rationale behind the introduction of the &ldquo;CBDC&rdquo; payment system? On the surface the purported motivation is to adapt to the &ldquo;changing&rdquo; payment landscape. This is not a credible motivation since it does not explain the need for this new &ldquo;CBDC&rdquo; retail payment system but vaguely states a fact that the retail payment landscape is changing (e.g. namely that people are using cash less frequently than they used to for retail payments). Thus, one has to ask oneself what is the motivation for pursuing this &ldquo;CBDC&rdquo; retail payment system that is currently not being fleshed out explicitly?</p>
<p>I think that the real reason for the push towards the introduction of a &ldquo;CBDC&rdquo; retail payment system is to eventually allow for the discontinuation of physical bank notes and coins. Eliminating the need for physical bank notes and coins has several advantages to the government:</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows for better monitoring (e.g. tax collection could improve)</li>
<li>It allows for the introduction of deeply negative short term interest rates</li>
</ol>
<p>In relation to the latter point, the introduction of deeply negative interest rates is not feasible as long as people can withdraw all of their savings in the form of physical bank notes and/or (even better) coins. In fact, the massive withdrawal of bank notes or coins from the financial system would threathen the stability of commerical banks.</p>
<p>To allow for the introduction of deeply negative interest rates one has to prevent people from withdrawing their savings from the financial system. Thus, the need to abolish physical bank notes and coins.</p>
<p>There are several disadvantages when removing access to physical bank notes and/or coins. Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Less resilient payment system landscape (e.g. cyber risks increase)</li>
<li>Anonymous payment in the form of money is no longer allowed</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter point raises a question of law which is the following: does the individual need to disclose to the government more information than he has to under the normative state? The clear answer from a normative point of view is negative but as we might suspect, the abolition of anonymous forms of money payment would make it impossible to disclose unnecessary (under the normative state) information to the administrative state (e.g. the government). Thus, one can conclude that the introduction of the &ldquo;CBDC&rdquo; retail payment system coupled with the abolition of anonymous money payment systems would increase the relative power of the administrative state vis-à-vis the normative one.</p>
