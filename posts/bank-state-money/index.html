			<h1>Bank and State Money</h1>

			<div>
				<p>This post is about the money of the State and the money of the Banks and how the two relate to each other.</p>
<p>In medieval times the money of the State was separate from that of the Bank whereas in modern times the two monies intermingle and are closely knitted together. This post tries to explain this.</p>
<p>We know that the State can create money on its own right as a sovereign entity. Hence, conceptually the State does not need the money of the Banks as it can create its own at will.</p>
<p>While the above is true, in a practical setting it can be the case that the sovereign may borrow from a Bank but this may occur only if there is a practical need being satisfied by such services. These could amount to the following: the need to borrow resources today without having to increase taxes today.</p>
<p>Indeed, a State should issue its own money only as long as it is confident it can redeem it in short order by offering governmental services. If this is not possible as the money needs to pay for a long running project, then borrowing resources instead of issuing State&rsquo;s money may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Having said all of the above, in the current institutional framework, States no longer issue their own money (they nominally do still but the amount is negligible as the coinage issued is usually of very low denomination) but instead rely mostly on borrowing from Banks whenever they want to acquire resources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, States accept Bank money for payment of taxes and pay for current expenditure with Bank money as well. Hence, we could argue that Bank money has fully replaced the money of the State.</p>
<p>Hence, to understand today&rsquo;s money, you need to understand Bank money and how the State is using it.</p>
<p>We start by asserting that the State fixes a relationship between the Bank money and a certain amount of resources. The State does this by paying for current expenditure with Bank money.</p>
<p>Hence, we can assert for example that the State fixes a 1-to-1 relationship between the Bank&rsquo;s money and the amount of resources being supplied.</p>
<p>Conceptually then the Bank&rsquo;s money is a claim on all of these resources. Then the value of the Bank&rsquo;s money vis-a-vis the resources is 1.</p>
<p>If the Bank were to issue money against debt to non-State entities, then that money would have to be exchanged for the amount of resources at an exchange rate of 1 as that would imply no immediate profit/loss for either Party to the exchange. If the exchange rate deviates from 1 then a profit/loss is incurred by one Party to the exchange. This conceptually should not happen.</p>
<p>As a result, in the current institutional framework of State and Banks, we can state that the State fixes the relationship between the Bank&rsquo;s money and the amount of resources by contributing new assets/resources to the Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet by paying civil servants with Bank money. The Banks instead control the amount of debt money being created. That is money that is not created at inception via the exchange of goods/resources for money (this is done by the State as explained previously) but instead by the exchange of debt for money. Furthermore, the Banks control the level of interest being paid out to holder of Bank&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>Hence, Bank money is not only a claim on the current assets/resources of the Bank (as explained above this enforces a fixed ratio of exchange of Bank money for assets/resources) but also represents a promise to claim assets of the Bank as they would stand in the future (the interest rate controls how this claim evolves in the future).</p>
<p>In the current institutional framework, the State pays the civil service an amount of Bank money for services rendered.</p>
<p>Let us start from the inception, where the State pays for the first time for services rendered with Bank money. The Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet would look as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here the Bank acquires 100 units of services rendered and the State declares that that amount of services rendered should equate to 100 units of Bank&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>At time zero, the Bank may then opt to issue debt money to another Party who has not worked for the State (let us assume this Party is called A). Then the balance sheet of the Bank would look as follows at time zero just after the issuance of debt money.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 debt notes issued by Party A</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And Party&rsquo;s A balance sheet would look as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100 debt notes |</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 Bank&rsquo;s money</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Party A wishes to spend the 100 Bank&rsquo;s money in the asset side of its balance sheet and exchange these 100 units of Bank&rsquo;s money for goods.</p>
<p>Pary A finds Party B who wishes to sell services.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the exchange rate agreed between Party A and Party B to exchange Bank&rsquo;s money and services is 0.9. Then that would mean that for each unit of Bank money Party A would receive 0.9 units of services from Party B.</p>
<p>Hence, the new balance sheets would look as follows.</p>
<p>Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 debt notes issued by Party A</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Party A balance sheet</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100 debt notes |</td>
<td style="text-align:right">90 services rendered</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Party B balance sheet</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">None</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 Bank&rsquo;s money</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We have to remember that the 100 debt notes issued by Party A are a claim on the assets of Party A. Hence, the 100 debt notes can be translated to 90 units of services rendered. Hence the new Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet would look as follows after translation.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100</td>
<td style="text-align:right">90 services rendered</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hence, the Bank has 200 units of liabilities and 190 units of services rendered as assets. Then that would mean that each unit of Bank&rsquo;s money can be exchanged for 0.95 units of services rendered.</p>
<p>We know that Party B paid 90 service units to acquire 100 units of Bank&rsquo;s money. But now Party B can redeem 100 units of Bank&rsquo;s money for 95 units of services rendered. Hence, Party B stands to make an immediate profit of 5 units of services rendered at time zero without having to pay anything. This is an arbitrage opportunity that may not exist. Hence, this explains why the ratio of exchange between the money issued by the Bank and the amount of resources cannot deviate substantially from that fixed by the State at time zero. Hence, to avoid this arbitrage opportunity, Party A and Party B would have to agree on an exchange rate of 1 instead of an exchange rate of 0.9. If this is the case, then the Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet would look as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the above case, the exchange rate between the Bank&rsquo;s money and the units of assets is maintained fixed at 1 which prevents any arbitrage opportunity.</p>
<p>Let us move forward by one time step, to time 1 where the State makes another payment to civil servant of 120 units of Bank&rsquo;s money in exchange for 100 units of services rendered. In this case, the exchange rate of Bank&rsquo;s money for units of services fixed by the State is going up from 1 to 1.2. Furthermore, let us assume that the Bank pays no interest on the money issued.</p>
<p>The new balance sheet of the Bank is going to look as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100 issued at time 0 |</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered at time 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">100 issued at time 0 |</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered at time 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">120 issued at time 1 |</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered at time 1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now the Bank has 320 money issued and 300 units of assets. Hence, the implied exchange rate between Bank&rsquo;s money and the assets is 0.9375. Hence, every unit of Bank&rsquo;s money can claim 0.9375 units of assets.</p>
<p>The civil servant who receives 120 units of Bank&rsquo;s money at time 1 stands to make an immediate profit of 12.5 units of assets as the civil servant paid in 100 units of services but s/he can claim 112.5 units of services from the Bank. On the other hand, the parties who hold the other 200 units of Bank&rsquo;s money stand to lose as they can claim 187.5 units of assets at time 1 from the Bank whereas at time 0 they could have claimed 200 units of assets from the Bank; hence, they stand to lose 12.5 units of assets at time 1.</p>
<p>Assuming the Bank instead pays an interest of 20% on liabilities, the Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet at time 1 would look as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Liabilities</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Assets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">120 - 100 issued at time 0 + 20 interest |</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered at time 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">120 - 100 issued at time 0 + 20 interest |</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered at time 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">120 issued at time 1 |</td>
<td style="text-align:right">100 services rendered at time 1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The implied exchange rate of Bank&rsquo;s money for assets is 1 (the same as the one implied at time 0). Hence, with an interest of 20% applied to Bank&rsquo;s money when moving from time zero to time one, no Party stands to make an immediate profit or loss.</p>
<p>Hence, we could argue that the Bank should set the level of interest for its own money to a level so as to guarantee that no Party makes an immediate profit or loss.</p>
<p>Hence, we can state that the level of interest is determined by the exchange rate fixed by the State at every point in time when it pays its civil servants. If the amount of money the State pays its civil servants goes up rapidly, then the Bank&rsquo;s interest rate should go up. On the other hand, if the amount of money the State is paying its civil servants is going down, then the level of interest of Bank&rsquo;s money should go down.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>We can conclude that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The State fixes the exchange rate between the money of the Bank and the amount of resources/assets</li>
<li>The Bank can control:
<ul>
<li>the amount of interest to be paid out to holders of the Bank&rsquo;s money and</li>
<li>the amount of debt Bank money issued at any one time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
